            <h1>Their lives depend on <br> your donation</h1>
            <p>People can become desensitized to appeals for donations. Here’s how to overcome the collapse of compassion.</p>
            <p>Following natural disasters like a hurricane or earthquake, many people rely on the generosity of strangers to help rebuild their lives. Donations to disaster relief organizations, local food and diaper banks, and other charities can make
                a big difference to people in great need.</p>

            <h1>They need us<br> to survive</h1>
            <p>According to the Sylhet Water Development Board (WDB), river water has never risen so much since 2008. This is the biggest flood in the last 3 decades and WDB officials fear the flood situation could worsen further if the rains continue upstream.
                Since 9th May at least 100 people have died with over 2000 villages hit by the severe flooding. It is predicted that the rainfall may continue till the end of June which could cause more flash flooding and affect thousands more people.
                And this is all before the monsoon rain starts from July.</p>

            <h1>Goverment are also helpless without your donation</h1>
            <p>More than a dozen people have died across the country since heavy monsoon rains began last week, authorities said. The government called in soldiers on Friday to help evacuate people to safety. Enamur Rahman, junior minister for disaster and
                relief, said up to 100,000 people have been evacuated in the worst-hit Sunamganj and Sylhet districts, and about four million people have been marooned in the area, the United News of Bangladesh agency reported. Officials said water has
                started receding from the northeastern region but is posing a threat to the country’s central region, the pathway for flood waters to reach the Bay of Bengal in the south. Media reports said those affected by flooding in remote areas are
                struggling to access drinking water and food.</p>
